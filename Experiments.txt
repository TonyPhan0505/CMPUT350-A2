Describe your experimental setup and your results.

Setup:
    _ Each experiment is made of the combination (width, height, #marines, #tanks, bounce, attack policies).
    _ Each experiment has a unique combination of (#marines, #tanks, bounce).
    _ So, there will be 8 experiments:
        #1: (700, 700, 20, 20, true, red_pols, blue_pols)
        #2: (700, 700, 50, 50, true, red_pols, blue_pols)
        #3: (700, 700, 100, 100, true, red_pols, blue_pols)
        #4: (700, 700, 300, 300, true, red_pols, blue_pols)
        #5: (700, 700, 20, 20, false, red_pols, blue_pols)
        #6: (700, 700, 50, 50, false, red_pols, blue_pols)
        #7: (700, 700, 100, 100, false, red_pols, blue_pols)
        #8: (700, 700, 300, 300, false, red_pols, blue_pols)
    _ Each experiment will have 3 scenarios to compare our 3 attack policies:
        > red (ATTACK_CLOSEST) vs blue (ATTACK_WEAKEST)
        > red (ATTACK_CLOSEST) vs blue (ATTACK_MOST_DANGEROUS)
        > red (ATTACK_WEAKEST) vs blue (ATTACK_MOST_DANGEROUS)
    _ After each scenario, the winning team, its corresponding attack policy and the number of its remaining units are recorded.
    _ The winning attack policy of an experiment is the policy that wins twice. 
    _ If there are more than 1 policies that win twice, then we break the tie by determining which has the most number of units left.
    _ Each experiment is run 100 times.
    _ The overall best attack policy is the one that wins most often after 8 experiments.

Results:
    _ Winning attack policy of experiment #1:
    _ Winning attack policy of experiment #2:
    _ Winning attack policy of experiment #3:
    _ Winning attack policy of experiment #4:
    _ Winning attack policy of experiment #5:
    _ Winning attack policy of experiment #6:
    _ Winning attack policy of experiment #7:
    _ Winning attack policy of experiment #8:
    _ Overall best attack policy:
