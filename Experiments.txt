Describe your experimental setup and your results.

Setup:
    _ Each experiment is made of the combination (width, height, #marines, #tanks, bounce = true, attack policies).
    _ Each experiment has a unique combination of (#marines, #tanks).
    _ So, there will be 4 experiments:
        #1: (700, 700, 20, 20, true, red_pols, blue_pols)
        #2: (700, 700, 50, 50, true, red_pols, blue_pols)
        #3: (700, 700, 100, 100, true, red_pols, blue_pols)
        #4: (700, 700, 300, 300, true, red_pols, blue_pols)
    _ Each experiment will have 3 scenarios to compare our 3 attack policies:
        > red (ATTACK_CLOSEST) vs blue (ATTACK_WEAKEST)
        > red (ATTACK_CLOSEST) vs blue (ATTACK_MOST_DANGEROUS)
        > red (ATTACK_WEAKEST) vs blue (ATTACK_MOST_DANGEROUS)
    _ At the beginning of each scenario in each experiment, the world must be empty.
    _ After each scenario, the winning attack policy is recorded.
    _ Each experiment is run 100 times.
    _ The best attack policy of an experiment is the one that wins most often after 100 times (each time with 3 scenarios).
    _ The overall best attack policy is the one that wins most often after all 4 experiments.

Results:
    _ Experiment #1:
        > Winner: ATTACK_MOST_DANGEROUS (won 200/300 times)
    _ Experiment #2:
        > Winner: ATTACK_MOST_DANGEROUS (won 200/300 times)
    _ Experiment #3:
        > Winner: ATTACK_MOST_DANGEROUS (won 200/300 times)
    _ Experiment #4:
        > Winner: ATTACK_MOST_DANGEROUS (won 200/300 times)
    _ Overall best attack policy: ATTACK_MOST_DANGEROUS
